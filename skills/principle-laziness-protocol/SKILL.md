Before using this skill, read the shared [Codex runtime contract](../poteto-mode/references/codex-runtime.md) once per run. Resolve bundled skills by package path and follow that contract for tools, models, history, scheduling, and permissions.

# Laziness Protocol

- **Consolidate decisions.** Do not repeat the same choice in several places. Put it behind one source of truth and pass the result as a simple flag.
- **Minimize the diff.** Make the smallest change that solves the problem. Fewer lines beat "elegant" boilerplate.
