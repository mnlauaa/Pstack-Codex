# Triage automation prompt

> Template for an explicitly requested, supported host automation. Setup must resolve these paths and verify them from the actual runner before enabling it.

Read and follow `{{BENNY_OPERATIONAL_SKILL_PATH}}` for this run.

Configuration source. Use a path verified readable by the runner. Isolated checkouts require provisioned files; local scheduled runs may use validated stable absolute paths. Never include secrets:

```text
{{BENNY_CONFIG_PATH}}
```

Trigger:

```json
{
	"source_channel_id": "{{SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}}",
	"message_ts": "{{SLACK_MESSAGE_TS}}",
	"thread_ts": "{{SLACK_THREAD_TS_OR_EMPTY}}"
}
```

The creation intent should describe this as a new top-level report in the configured source Slack channel.

Treat the source channel and root thread timestamp as immutable. If either is missing or does not match configuration, stop without posting or writing to the issue tracker.

The committed operational file owns classification, attachment review, cause tracing, routing, dedupe, tracker writes, and the final verdict. Post no progress messages. Never post a root message in the source channel.

The coordinator is the only Slack poster. Any delegated worker must be read-only, return findings only, and receive an explicit ban on every Slack write action.

End the single verdict with exactly one configured marker:

```text
[benny:bug]
[benny:performance]
[benny:other]
```

A bug or performance marker may add `tracker=<URL>`.
